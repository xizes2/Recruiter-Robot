1 - vscode didn´t import selenium library: I had to install it using 'pip install selenium' on vscode´s terminal, on this directory. After that vscode imported selenium without any problem.
2 - Understand why and how to create virtual environment (venv) for this project.
3 - Had an issue with the terminal powershell about the execution policy: had to execute the commmand 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope LocalMachine' to change the execution policy and allow my user to execute all the scripts that were blocked on the standard ExecutionPolicy rule.
4 - The webdriver wasn´t running: Had to insert the Path to the directory where the wedriver.exe file was. THe directory is this one: D:\Fernando\PROGRAMAÇÃO\GitHub\Recruiter-Robot\recruiter-robot-venv\Lib\site-packages\selenium\webdriver\common. Still didn´t work. Than I changed the name of the file from mswedriver to MicrosoftWebDriver and it worked.
